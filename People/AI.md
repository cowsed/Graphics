## Musical intelligence
people like music they heard as a kid
need a way of turning notes and stuff into a genre 
dont have to be the exact same note to cause a similar reaction
a NN would probably work well here for extracting mood/genre but thats hard - alternatively just come up with a genre string when musis never actually is a sound and is just a message broadcasted in the world


##Future
 memory holding objects
 blueprints/plans
 allows for books and written stories
