PROBLEMS



Fix the getting of world coordinates by ray tracing througharray (rn its weirdly mirrored)
somehow stop it from going to the block under a corner because that really makes no sense
functionize it
allow for intersection with entities





Only updating the list of sprites when updating the world is bad like highly problematic
Should update it whenever a sprite is added - or at least a dirty flag to recalculate once all the sprites have been added/changed position

Adding and removing sprites each frame as a way to update them is ... questionable
	requires lots of triple loops
	
The Current solution to rendering sprites has the smae problems as the tile list in that allocating space can not be continous cuz you dont know how many to allocate


FIX SPTITE RENDEREING WHEN IN THE SAME CHUNK

RN ONLY WORKS WITH 1 SPRITE PER CHUNK

v
also figure out why draw to batch  and set dirty is called som often
updating every frame even when the debug setDirty is off
It seems to come from FindVisible which seems to be called each loop
sike thats just cuz theres 25
it now seems that that was purely because i cant count to 25

v
problem is adjacent tl the score generating system 
scores are generated and for whatever reason the sprites always get drawn first
which is wrong
very wrong

v yo i fixed it
changed order in call to calcscore that was wrong
added section to finish adding sprites that are above top tile

World Generator/Art
make tiles for back , back side, front, front side that are added by world generation or something to 
for all intents and purposes they are the same as regular grass but show depth
