PROBLEMS

Only updating the list of sprites when updating the world is bad like highly problematic
Should update it whenever a sprite is added - or at least a dirty flag to recalculate once all the sprites have been added/changed position

Adding and removing sprites each frame as a way to update them is ... questionable
	requires lots of triple loops
	
The Current solution to rendering sprites has the smae problems as the tile list in that allocating space can not be continous cuz you dont know how many to allocate
